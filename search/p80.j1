Tuberin and hamartin form a complex that inhibits signaling by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a critical nutrient sensor and regulator of cell growth and proliferation. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inactivates the tumor suppressor complex and enhances mTOR signaling by means of phosphorylation of tuberin by Akt. Importantly, cellular transformation mediated by phorbol esters and Ras isoforms that poorly activate PI3K promote tumorigenesis in the absence of Akt activation. In this study, we show that phorbol esters and activated Ras also induce the phosphorylation of tuberin and collaborates with the nutrient-sensing pathway to regulate mTOR effectors, such as p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activated kinase, p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) 1, was found to interact with and phosphorylate tuberin at a regulatory site, Ser-1798, located at the evolutionarily conserved C terminus of tuberin. RSK1 phosphorylation of Ser-1798 inhibits the tumor suppressor function of the tuberin/hamartin complex, resulting in increased mTOR signaling to S6K1. Together, our data unveil a regulatory mechanism by which the Ras/MAPK and PI3K pathways converge on the tumor suppressor tuberin to inhibit its function.","Citations":"489","Year":"2004" ,

These phosphorylations may play a role in negative feedback of Ras stimulation and have been shown to be mediated in part by the MAP kinases Erk-1 and Erk-2. Here we show that in addition to MAP kinase, a major mitogen activated kinase for SOS is p90 Rsk-2, a downstream target of MAP kinase. p90 Rsk-2 phosphorylates SOS in an in gel assay and also in solution in vitro. The ability of p90 Rsk-2 to phosphorylate SOS increases greatly following EGF treatment of PC12 cells and is blocked by expression of N17 Ras or treatment with the MEK inhibitor PD98059. Phosphopeptide mapping revealed that the sites phosphorylated by p90 Rsk-2 in vitro were also phosphorylated in intact cells in response to EGF treatment. Several major sites of in vivo phosphorylation correlated with p90 Rsk-2 phosphorylation sites rather than MAP kinase sites. It is therefore likely that p90 Rsk-2 plays an important role in the down regulation of the Ras activation pathway through SOS.","Citations":"128","Year":"1997" } ,

Two of the known AGE-binding proteins isolated from rat liver membranes, p60 and p90, have been partially sequenced. We now report that the N-terminal sequence of p60 exhibits 95% identity to OST-48, a 48-kDa member of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex found in microsomal membranes, while sequence analysis of p90 revealed 73% and 85% identity to the N-terminal and internal sequences, respectively, of human 80K-H, a 80- to 87-kDa protein substrate for protein kinase C. AGE-ligand and Western analyses of purified oligosaccharyltransferase complex, enriched rough endoplasmic reticulum, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membranes from rat liver or RAW 264.7 macrophages yielded a single protein of approximately 50 kDa recognized by both anti-p60 and anti-OST-48 antibodies, and also exhibited AGE-specific binding. Immunoprecipitated OST-48 from rat rough endoplasmic reticulum fractions exhibited both AGE binding and immunoreactivity to an anti-p60 antibody. Immune IgG raised to recombinant OST-48 and 80K-H inhibited binding of AGE-bovine serum albumin to cell membranes in a dose-dependent manner. Immunostaining and flow cytometry demonstrated the surface expression of OST-48 and 80K-H on numerous cell types and tissues, including mononuclear, endothelial, renal, and brain neuronal and glial cells. We conclude that the AGE receptor components p60 and p90 are identical to OST-48, and 80K-H, respectively, and that they together contribute to the processing of AGEs from extra- and intracellular compartments and in the cellular responses associated with these pathogenic substances.","Citations":"310","Year":"1996" } ,

The 17mer antisense probe, EAS 1, caused a potent and concentration-dependent decrease in the steady state expression of p42 and p44 MAP kinase in 3T3 L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes with submicromolar concentrations effective. Antisense EAS 1 elicited a dose-dependent inhibition of insulin- and serum-stimulated DNA synthesis. Elimination of p42 MAP kinase by > 95% and p44 MAP kinase to levels undetected blocked the ability of serum in 3T3 L1 fibroblasts and insulin in 3T3 L1 adipocytes to stimulate DNA synthesis by 87-95%. The differentiation of 3T3 L1 fibroblasts into adipocytes was prevented by 1 microM antisense EAS 1. The corresponding sense, scrambled or sense plus antisense EAS 1 phosphorothioate oligonucleotides did not deplete the p42 or p44 MAP kinase from either cell type, did not inhibit stimulation of DNA synthesis and did not interfere with differentiation. Two kinases on different MAP kinase activation pathways were not depleted by antisense EAS 1 whereas the ability of insulin to activate p90 S6 kinase was > 90% eliminated in 3T3 L1 adipocytes by 4.5 microM antisense EAS 1. In conclusion these results show that MAP kinase is required for insulin and serum stimulation of DNA synthesis, for insulin stimulation of p90 S6 kinase activity and for differentiation of 3T3 L1 cells. Moreover, the development of the antisense probe EAS 1 against a target sequence of p42 MAP kinase that is conserved in p44 MAP kinase and across a range of species provides a molecular tool of general applicability for further dissecting the precise targets and roles of MAP kinase.","Citations":"243","Year":"1995" } ,

The protein kinase p90 Rsk is a substrate of p42 MAPK; thus, the role of p90 Rsk in p42 MAPK-induced mitotic arrest was examined. Xenopus laevis egg extracts immunodepleted of Rsk lost their capacity to undergo mitotic arrest in response to activation of the Mos-MEK-1-p42 MAPK cascade of protein kinases.

We have now identified the first small-molecule, RSK-specific inhibitor, which we isolated from the tropical plant Forsteronia refracta. We have named this novel inhibitor SL0101. SL0101 shows remarkable specificity for RSK. The major determinant of SL0101-binding specificity is the unique ATP-interacting sequence in the amino-terminal kinase domain of RSK. SL0101 inhibits proliferation of the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, producing a cell cycle block in G(1) phase with an efficacy paralleling its ability to inhibit RSK in intact cells. RNA interference of RSK expression confirmed that RSK regulates MCF-7 proliferation. Interestingly, SL0101 does not alter proliferation of a normal human breast cell line MCF-10A, although SL0101 inhibits RSK in these cells. We show that RSK is overexpressed in approximately 50% of human breast cancer tissue samples, suggesting that regulation of RSK has been compromised. Thus, we show that RSK has an unexpected role in proliferation of transformed cells and may be a useful new target for chemotherapeutic agents. SL0101 will provide a powerful new tool to dissect the molecular functions of RSK in cancer cells.","Citations":"199","Year":"2005" } ,

Many proteins integrate and are modulated by multiple phosphorylation events derived from complex signaling cues. Simultaneous detection and quantification of temporal changes in all of a protein's phosphorylation sites could provide not only an immediate assessment of a known biochemical activity but also important insights into molecular signaling mechanisms. Here we show the use of stable isotope-based quantitative MS to globally monitor the kinetics of complex, ordered phosphorylation events on protein players in the canonical mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. In excellent agreement with activity assays and phosphospecific immunoblotting with the same samples, we quantified epidermal growth factor-induced changes in nine phosphorylation sites in the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/p90 ribosomal S6 kinase-signaling cassette. Additionally, we monitored 14 previously uncharacterized and six known phosphorylation events after phorbol ester stimulation in the ERK/p90 ribosomal S6 kinase-signaling targets, the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) tumor suppressors TSC1 and TSC2. By using quantitative phosphorylation profiling in conjunction with pharmacological kinase inhibitors we uncovered a ERK-independent, protein kinase C-dependent pathway to TSC2 phosphorylation. These results establish quantitative phosphorylation profiling as a means to simultaneously identify, quantify, and delineate the kinetic changes of ordered phosphorylation events on a given protein and defines parameters for the rapid discovery of important in vivo phosphoregulatory mechanisms.","Citations":"183","Year":"2005" } ,

It can be difficult to assess the individual functions of each AGC kinase because their substrate specificities are similar. Here we describe the small molecule BI-D1870, which inhibits RSK1, RSK2, RSK3 and RSK4 in vitro with an IC(50) of 10-30 nM, but does not signi-ficantly inhibit ten other AGC kinase members and over 40 other protein kinases tested at 100-fold higher concentrations.

Moreover, BI-D1870 does not suppress the phorbol ester- or EGF-induced phosphorylation of CREB (cAMP-response-element-binding protein), consistent with the genetic evidence indicating that MSK, and not RSK, isoforms mediate the mitogen-induced phosphorylation of this transcription factor.","Citations":"167","Year":"2007" } ,

The p90 ribosomal S6 kinases (RSKs) comprise a family of serine/threonine kinases that lie at the terminus of the ERK pathway. Efficient RSK activation by ERK requires its interaction through a docking site located near the C terminus of RSK, but the regulation of this interaction remains unknown. In this report we show that RSK1 and ERK1/2 form a complex in quiescent HEK293 cells that transiently dissociates upon mitogen stimulation. Complex dissociation requires phosphorylation of RSK1 serine 749, which is a mitogen-regulated phosphorylation site located near the ERK docking site. Using recombinant RSK1 proteins, we find that serine 749 is phosphorylated by the N-terminal kinase domain of RSK1 in vitro, suggesting that ERK1/2 dissociation is mediated through RSK1 autophosphorylation of this residue. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that inactivating mutations in the RSK1 kinase domains disrupted the mitogen-regulated dissociation of ERK1/2 in vivo. Analysis of different RSK isoforms revealed that RSK1 and RSK2 readily dissociate from ERK1/2 following mitogen stimulation but that RSK3 remains associated with active ERK1/2. RSK activity assays revealed that RSK3 also remains active longer than RSK1 and RSK2, suggesting that prolonged ERK association increased the duration of RSK3 activation. These results provide new evidence for the regulated nature of ERK docking interactions and reveal important differences among the closely related RSK family members.","Citations":"149","Year":"2003" } ,

The cyclin-dependent kinase-inhibitory activity of p27Kip1 is regulated by changes in its concentration and its subcellular localization. Several reports suggest that phosphorylation of p27Kip1 at serine 10, threonine 157, and threonine 187 regulate its localization. We have previously identified that carboxyl-terminal threonine 198 (Thr198) in p27Kip1 is a novel phosphorylation site and that Akt is associated with the phosphorylation at the site (Fujita, N., Sato, S., Katayama, K., and Tsuruo, T. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 28706-28713). We show herein that activation of the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPK kinase/MEK) pathway also regulates phosphorylation of p27Kip1 at Thr198. MAPKs were not directly associated with p27Kip1 phosphorylation at Thr198, but the p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinases (RSKs) could bind to and directly phosphorylate p27Kip1 at Thr198 in a Ras/Raf/MEK-dependent manner. RSK-dependent phosphorylation promoted the p27Kip1 binding to 14-3-3 and its cytoplasmic localization. To prove the direct relationship between 14-3-3 binding and cytoplasmic localization, we constructed a p27Kip1-R18 fusion protein in which the R18 peptide was fused to the carboxyl-terminal region of p27Kip1. The R18 peptide is known to interact with 14-3-3 independent of phosphorylation. The p27Kip1-R18 distributed mainly in the cytosol, whereas mutant p27Kip1-R18 (p27Kip1-R18-K2) that had no 14-3-3 binding capability existed mainly in the nucleus. These results indicate that RSKs play a crucial role in cell cycle progression through translocation of p27Kip1, in addition to Akt, to the cytoplasm in a phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding-dependent manner.","Citations":"151","Year":"2003" } ,

A potentially important downstream effector of Src and ERK1/2 is p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK), which plays an important role in cell growth by activating several transcription factors as well as the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger. In the present study, we determined whether H(2)O(2) activates p90RSK to gain insight into signal transduction mechanisms activated by reactive oxygen species. H(2)O(2) (200 microM) stimulated ERK1/2 and p90RSK activity in lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. The MEK-1 inhibitor, PD98059 (30 microM), inhibited H(2)O(2)-mediated activation of ERK1/2 but not of p90RSK. An essential role for Fyn and Ras in p90RSK activation was suggested by five findings. 1) The tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A, and the specific Src kinase family inhibitor, PP1, blocked p90RSK activation by H(2)O(2) in a concentration-dependent manner. 2) p90RSK activation by H(2)O(2) was significantly reduced in fibroblasts derived from transgenic mice deficient in Fyn, but not c-Src. 3) H(2)O(2) rapidly activated Ras (peak at 2-5 min), which preceded p90RSK activation (peak at 20 min). 4) Dominant negative Ras completely blocked H(2)O(2)-induced activation of p90RSK. 5) In Fyn-/- fibroblasts, activation of Ras by H(2)O(2) was significantly attenuated. These results show essential roles for Fyn and Ras in H(2)O(2)-mediated activation of p90RSK and establish redox-sensitive regulation of Ras and p90RSK as a new function for Fyn.","Citations":"138","Year":"2000" } ,

To determine RSK2 function in vivo, mice lacking a functional rsk2 gene were generated and studied in response to insulin and exercise, two potent stimulators of the ERK cascade in skeletal muscle. RSK2 knockout (KO) mice weigh 10% less and are 14% shorter than wild-type (WT) mice. They also have impaired learning and coordination. Hindlimb skeletal muscles were obtained from mice 10, 15, or 30 min after insulin injection or immediately after strenuous treadmill exercise for 60 min. While insulin and exercise significantly increased ERK phosphorylation in skeletal muscle from both WT and KO mice, the increases were twofold greater in the KO animals. This occurred despite 27% lower ERK2 protein expression in skeletal muscle of KO mice. KO mice had 18% less muscle glycogen in the fasted basal state, and insulin increased glycogen synthase activity more in KO than WT mice. The enhanced insulin-stimulated increases in ERK and glycogen synthase activities in KO mice were not associated with higher insulin receptor or with IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation or with IRS1 binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. However, insulin-stimulated serine phosphorylation of Akt was significantly higher in the KO animals. c-fos mRNA was increased similarly in muscle from WT and KO mice in response to insulin (2. 5-fold) and exercise (15-fold). In conclusion, RSK2 likely plays a major role in feedback inhibition of the ERK pathway in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, RSK2 is not required for activation of muscle glycogen synthase by insulin but may indirectly modulate muscle glycogen synthase activity and/or glycogen content by other mechanisms, possibly through regulation of Akt. RSK2 knockout mice may be a good animal model for the study of Coffin-Lowry syndrome.","Citations":"121","Year":"2001" } ,

Increasing RSK isoform 2 (RSK2) levels in the human prostate cancer line, LNCaP, enhanced prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression, an important diagnostic marker for prostate cancer, whereas inhibiting RSK activity using a RSK-specific inhibitor, 3Ac-SL0101, decreased PSA expression. The RSK2 regulation of PSA expression occurred via a mechanism involving both RSK2 kinase activity and its ability to associate with the coactivator, p300. RNA interference of the androgen receptor (AR) showed that the AR was important in the RSK2-mediated increase in PSA expression. RSK levels are higher in approximately 50% of human prostate cancers compared with normal prostate tissue, which suggests that increased RSK levels may participate in the rise in PSA expression that occurs in prostate cancer. Furthermore, 3Ac-SL0101 inhibited proliferation of the LNCaP line and the androgen-independent human prostate cancer line, PC-3.
